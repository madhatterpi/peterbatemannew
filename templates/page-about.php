        <p class="about-me__text">I studied philosophy at university, I dabbled in graphics design and now I'm a web developer. This is my first year as a web developer but despite being relatively new to the game I believe I have the skillset to produce beautiful and high functioning websites. I'm offering low rates for the moment so this is a great opportunity to get a new website for cheaper than usual.</p>

          <h2 class="my-process__header">Research</h2>
            <p>The first step is to find out all about what you want from your website. So we'll catch up over a coffee or on Skype and talk ideas.</p>

          <h2 class="my-process__header">Design</h2>
          <p>An initial wireframe will be provided which will give an idea of the overall layout. Then a more detailed design that includes images and fonts will be made. You will be involved throughout this process so you can make suggestions and adjustments as we move ahead.</p>

          <h2 class="my-process__header">Build</h2>
          <p>The build stage will vary greatly depending on whether you want a custom Wordpress theme, a bought theme, or a Squarespace site. Whichever you choose the site will be built with the latest coding standards and will provide a great platform to build marketing your business on. Before the site goes live it will go through rigorous testing - programmatic testing and user testing.</p>

          <h2 class="my-process__header">Moving ahead</h2>
          <p>After handing over the website to you and teaching you the ins and outs of it I will remain on call for a couple of months to make sure the brief is hit and no issues got through screening. Now the site is built you want to make sure as many people in your target audience are seeing it. Fortunately, a lot of the work is already done because it was built with this in mind - images are compressed, scripts are minified, no links are broken and the site is speedy. But there is always more that can be done, for instance, keyword targetting, google analytics and backlinks. Let's talk about it and push the website even further.</p>
