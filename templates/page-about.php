    <p>This is my first year as a web developer and my rates reflect this. I feel my work speaks for itself, my portfolio and reviews show that I produce high quality and visually stunning websites. This is an opportunity for you to get a great website for cheaper than if you went with a big design agency. This is my first year as a developer and I am offering very reasonable rates while I build up my portfolio. So this is a great oppportunity for you to get a great website for little cost.</p>

          <h2 class="about-process__section__header">Research</h2>
            <p>First step is for me to find out all about what you want from your website. So what you want it to look like, what sort of features it will include, how you want it to promote your business, things like this. Examples of sites you like can be helpful, as can looking at competitors and of course examples of things you don't like are also fine. The more detail we can put into this initial briefing stage the better.</p>

          <h2 class="about-process__section__header">Design</h2>
          <p>To keep costs low I aim to be as efficient as possible. Designing the majority of the site before building it is the way to do this but we will almost certainly do revisions and customizations as the site comes together. First, I'll create a wireframe so we can establish the general layout of the site because we need the site to be fully responsive this will include wireframes for different screen sizes. If you are happy with the layout I will design the site in more detial and create a stylesheet that will include the colour palette, fonts, and header sizes. I'll keep you involved throught this process so you can make suggestions and adjustments as we move ahead.</p>

          <h2 class="about-process__section__header">Build</h2>
          <p>I typically like to use Sage starter theme to build my sites because it is essentially a blank slate and allows the build to be very light and quick. However, if you want a site up really fast and cheap I can use a Wordpress theme, or even build the site with Wix or Squarespace. The website will be built using the latest web standards, which will give a good basis for solid SEO, and will look great on all screen sizes. Before the site goes live it will go through some tests and we will review it for errors and usability issues. And there we have it a brand new exiting website!</p>

          <h2 class="about-process__section__header">Feedback</h2>
          <p>After handing over the website to you and teaching you the ins and outs of it I will remain on call for a couple of months to make sure the brief is hit and no issues got through screening. Now the site is built you want to make sure as many people in your target audience are seeing it. Fortunately a lot of the work is already done because it was built with this in mind - images are compressed, scripts are minified, no links are broken and the site is speedy. But there is always more that can be done, for instance keyword targetting, google analytics and backlinks. Let's talk about it and push the website even further.</p>
