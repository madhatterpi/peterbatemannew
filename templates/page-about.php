        <p class="about-me__text">Before becoming a web developer I studied philosophy and religion at the University of Kent. I then went on to try my hand at content writing and graphic design. It wasn't long, although it felt it, before I found my true calling. The ultimate combination of left and right brain: designing and building websites! When I'm not at the computer I enjoy playing tennis, making vegan creations in the kitchen with my girlfriend and making digital art prints.</p>

          I am passionate about designing beautiful and user-friendly websites. I combine this passion with a compulsive nerdy need to write great code. I've been doing freelance web development for just over a year now. As a relative newbie I provide excellent value for money. I put the needs of your business first, which also invariably means the needs of your clients, and this results in a super user-friendly, SEO friendly and Google algorithm friendly website. </p>

          <h3>Whats the cost of a website?</h3>
          <p>This will vary greatly depending on what you need but generally a brochure style website will be between £1000 and £3000. If you let me know what your ideal website would be I can get back to you with a quote.</p>
          <h3>Do you only use Wordpress?</h3>
        <p>Wordpress is what I have most experience using and I think it is a superb option for almost all small to medium businesses. For smaller companies, or portfolio websites, I often use Squarespace as this provides a more cost-effective and simple to use product.</p>
        <h3>How long does a website take to build?</h3>
        <p>Typically a brochure website will take between 2 and 4 weeks after starting, e-commerce sites can take a bit longer. I remain on hand for a month after the website is handed over to iron out the kinks.</p>
